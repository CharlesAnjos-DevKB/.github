## CharlesAnjos' DevKB

### Introduction
In this organization I plan on uploading some of the stuff I'll be learning along my career as a Software Developer. 
From logic outlines to basic principles about stuff, to code snippets and repos with projects implementing basic functionality, 
mainly as a way to help me organize things and better remember stuff, but also maybe helping the community out by serving
as a form of documentation.

This is hopefully the first of many many commits to this and many many other repos under this organization.
